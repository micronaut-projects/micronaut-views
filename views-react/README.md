# React SSR support for Micronaut

This module uses GraalJS to implement server-side rendering for applications using React or similar libraries like Preact.

To get a project that uses it, try Micronaut Starter and request Views React. That will give you a fully functional
frontend project with build system integration (NPM and Webpack integrated with Maven and Gradle). You can then easily
add components and build up your frontend, or connect up an existing frontend codebase.
