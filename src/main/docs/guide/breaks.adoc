This section outlines the breaking changes done in major versions of Micronaut Views.

=== 3.0.0

* api:views.model.ViewModelProcessor[] no longer assumes a `Map<String,Object>` model and must be typed to the exact type of the model you would like to process.

== 2.0.0

* The `micronaut-views` dependency is no longer published. Replace the dependency with the one specific to the view implementation being used.
* Deprecated classes, constructors, etc have been removed.
* ViewsFilterOrderProvider has been removed. The view filter now always runs on `ServerFilterPhase.RENDERING`.
* Maven Group ID changed to `io.micronaut.views`
