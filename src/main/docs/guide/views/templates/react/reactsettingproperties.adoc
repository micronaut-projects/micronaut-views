React SSR needs some Micronaut application properties to be set.

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  # Point to client and server JS
  views:
    folder: classes/views
  router:
    static-resources:
      js:
        mapping: "/static/**"
        paths: "classpath:static"
----

If you want Micronaut to serve not only the pre-rendered HTML but also your Javascript assets you need to set up static file serving. Add the two properties you see above.

[[react-dev-mode]]
== Development

During development you want the fastest iteration speed possible. Firstly turn off response caching so hot reload works with `npx webpack --watch`. Micronaut Views React will automatically notice the file changed on disk and reload it.

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  # For development purposes only.
  server:
    netty:
      responses:
        file:
          cache-seconds: 0
----

If using Maven turn off Micronaut's automatic restart features so that changes to the compiled bundle JS don't cause the whole server to reboot:

[xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.micronaut.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>micronaut-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <configuration>
        <watches>
            <watch>
                <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
                <excludes>
                    <exclude>**/*.js</exclude>
                    <exclude>**/*.mjs</exclude>
                </excludes>
            </watch>
        </watches>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
