React SSR needs some Micronaut application properties to be set.

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  # HACK
  http:
    client:
      allow-block-event-loop: true

  # Point to client and server JS
  views:
    folder: classes/views
  router:
    static-resources:
      js:
        mapping: "/static/**"
        paths: "classpath:static"

  # For development purposes only.
  server:
    netty:
      responses:
        file:
          cache-seconds: 0
----

Set the hack property. TODO: This need will go away. The `micronaut.views.folder` property should also go away at some point.

If you want Micronaut to serve not only the pre-rendered HTML but also your Javascript assets you need to set up static file serving. Add the two properties you see above. TODO: Currently only /static/ is supported as a path. This will change.

Finally, consider turning off response caching in development if you want hot reload to work with `npx webpack --watch`.
