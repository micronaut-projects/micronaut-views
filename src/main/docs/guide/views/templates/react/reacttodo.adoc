Micronaut React SSR has the following known issues and limitations:

- Server-side prefetching is currently unfinished (not fetching in parallel), broken under load and should not be used for real.
- There is no sandboxing right now.
- The need for the thread hack property will go away. The `micronaut.views.folder` property should also go away at some point.
- The `Micronaut.prefetch` API could be replaced with a server-side implementation of the fetch API.
- The way props interact with Micronaut Security isn't documented.
- There is no way to extend the Javascript execution environment with custom Java-side objects.
- The rendering isn't streamed to the user.
- You must include a `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` polyfill, as GraalJS doesn't currently support it.
- There is no documentation on how to do debugging of the server-side JS.
- `<Suspense>` is not supported.
