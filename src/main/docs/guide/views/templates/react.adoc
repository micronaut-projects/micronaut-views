React server-side rendering (SSR) allows you to pre-render React components to HTML before the page is sent to the user.
This improves performance by ensuring the page appears before any Javascript has loaded (albeit in a non-responsive
state), makes it easier for search engines to index your pages, and can eliminate server round trips by pre-fetching
REST API calls that would otherwise be made by the browser.

Micronaut's support for React SSR has the following useful features:

* Javascript runs using https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalJS], a high performance Javascript engine native to the JVM. Make sure to run your app on GraalVM or by compiling it to a native image to get full Javascript performance.
* Compatible out of the box with both React and https://www.preactjs.com/[Preact], an alternative lighter weight implementation of the React concept.
* Customize the Javascript used to invoke SSR to add features like head managers, or use the prepackaged default scripts to get going straight away.
* You can pass any `@Introspectable` Java objects to use as _props_ for your page components. This is convenient for passing in things like the user profile info.
* You can integrate fetcher libraries like https://swr.vercel.app/[SWR] so Micronaut Views React can pre-fetch the API response server-side and then pass it to the client in the initial HTML. The docs show how to integrate this with the `useSWR` hook, which is the recommended way to use this feature. This reduces latency and improves robustness.
* Logging from Javascript is sent to the Micronaut logs. `console.log` and related will go to the `INFO` level of the logger named `js`, `console.error` and Javascript exceptions will go to the `ERROR` level of the same.

By default you will need React components that return the entire page, including the `<html>` tag. You'll also need to prepare your Javascript (see below). Then just name your required page component in the `@View` annotation on a controller, for example `@View("App")` will render the `<App/>` component with whatever object is provided as props.

To use React SSR you need to add two dependencies.

1. Add the `micronaut-views-react` dependency.
2. Add a dependency on `org.graalvm.polyglot:js` or `org.graalvm.polyglot:js-community`. The difference is to do with licensing and performance, with the `js` version being faster and free to use but not open source. https://www.graalvm.org/latest/docs/introduction/#licensing-and-support[Learn more about choosing an edition.]
