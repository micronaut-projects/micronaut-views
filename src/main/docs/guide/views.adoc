Although the Micronaut framework is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

The `views` module provides support for view rendering on the server side and does so by rendering views on the I/O thread pool in order to avoid blocking the Netty event loop.

To use the view rendering features described in this section, add a dependency based on the view rendering engine you prefer (see the following sections).


For file-based view schemes, views and templates can be placed in the `src/main/resources/views` directory of your
project. If you use this feature and wish to use a different folder, set the property `micronaut.views.folder`.

Your controller's method can render the response with a template by using the api:views.View[] annotation.

The following is an example of a controller which renders a template by passing a model as a `java.util.Map` via the returned response object.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/ViewsController.java
----
include::{testsviewsThymeleaf}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=clazz]

include::{testsviewsThymeleaf}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=map]

}
----

<1> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name which should be used to render a view for the route.

In addition, you can return any POJO object and the properties of the POJO will be exposed to the view for rendering:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/ViewsController.java
----
include::{testsviewsThymeleaf}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=clazz]

include::{testsviewsThymeleaf}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=pojo]

}
----

<1> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name which should be used to render the POJO responded by the controller.

Use the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-core/latest/api/io/micronaut/core/annotation/Introspected.html[@Introspected] annotation on your POJO object to  generate `BeanIntrospection` metadata at compilation time.

You can also return a api:views.ModelAndView[] and skip specifying the api:views.View[] annotation.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/ViewsController.java
----
include::{testsviewsThymeleaf}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=clazz]

include::{testsviewsThymeleaf}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=modelAndView]
----

Moreover, the Controller's method can return a POJO annotated with `@Introspected` to the view:

snippet::io.micronaut.views.model.FruitsController[tags="pojo"]

The following sections show different template engines integrations.

To create your own implementation create a class which implements api:views.ViewsRenderer[] and annotate it with https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-core/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Produces.html[@Produces] to the media types the view rendering supports producing.

TIP: If you want to render a template directly on your code (for example, to generate the body of an email) you can inject the ViewsRenderer bean and use its method "render".
